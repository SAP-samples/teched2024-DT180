# DT180 - Integrating SAP S/4HANA Cloud with SAP IBP using SAP Integration Suite

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2024 session called DT180 - Integrating SAP S/4HANA Cloud with SAP IBP using SAP Integration Suite.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to the SAP Integration Suite part of the demand planning integration between SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition and SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain (SAP IBP).
The SAP IBP solution holds a breadth of ERP information that is critical for many supply chain planning scenarios. SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition stands as a system of record and is important for planning data in SAP IBP. As a result, the need for integrating SAP IBP with SAP S/4HANA is critical for customers. Learn how to setup, configure and run this integration in SAP Integration Suite using interfaces in SAP IBP to exchange volumes of data with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are:
- (Needs to be adaptet to the new approach to access an existing test setup instead of a trial account)Set up an Integration Suite Trial as described here: https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-starter-isuite-onboard-subscribe..html

- log on to the Cloud Integration instance you are assigned to:
    https://teched2024-eu01.integrationsuite.cfapps.eu20-001.hana.ondemand.com/shell/home
    https://teched2024-eu02.integrationsuite.cfapps.eu20-001.hana.ondemand.com/shell/home
    https://teched2024-eu03.integrationsuite.cfapps.eu20-001.hana.ondemand.com/shell/home
    https://teched2024-us01.integrationsuite.cfapps.us21.hana.ondemand.com/shell/home
    https://teched2024-us02.integrationsuite.cfapps.us20.hana.ondemand.com/shell/home
- Create your own integration content package the following way:
  - Navigate to Design -> Integrations and APIs
  - Click button Create
  - Fill field Name with the following content: Session DT180 -your identifier-
      - -your identifier- should be a unique identifier representing your content
      - You can use your user name, but also a pseudonym
      - Ideally it is some term that is not used yet, as it simplifies searching for your log content later
      - We will reuse that identifier later on for other objects as well
  - Fill field Short Description with 'Wrapper iFlows for Session DT180', for example
  - Click Save  
 
Note: Please be aware that you are only allowed to access the Integration Suite. There are an S/4 and an IBP system connected and data can be transfered from S/4 to IBP, but you won't be able to access the S/4 and IBP systems. The back integration from IBP to S/4 is not supported in this test setup.
If you have test systems of type S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition and SAP Integrated Buisiness Planning for Supply Chain available and the needed authorizations in both systems to setup the communication you can follow the description in Best Practices Content 
IBP for demand â€“ demand forecast for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (78P) (https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-034/2408/SolP/78P)
This will allow you to go through all the setup steps and run the whole process end to end including the steps needed in S/4 and IBP.
